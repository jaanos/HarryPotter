Adolescence;"Adolescence (from Latin adolescere, meaning ""to grow up"") is a transitional stage of physical and psychological human development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood (age of majority). The period of adolescence is most closely associated with the teenage years, though its physical, psychological and cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later. For example, although puberty has been historically associated with the onset of adolescent development,it now typically begins prior to the teenage years and there has been a normative shift of it occurring in preadolescence, particularly in females."
Adult Fiction;Adult fiction, by contrast with children's or young adult , is fiction intended for (and usually about) adults.
Adventure;Adventure fiction is a genre of fiction in which an adventure, an exciting undertaking involving risk and physical danger, forms the main storyline. Adventure novels and short stories were popular subjects for American pulp magazines, which dominated American popular fiction between the Progressive Era and the 1950s. Adventure fiction often overlaps with other genres, notably war novels, crime novels, sea stories, Robinsonades, spy stories (as in the works of John Buchan, Eric Ambler and Ian Fleming), science fiction, fantasy, (Robert E. Howard and J.R.R. Tolkien both combined the secondary world story with the adventure novel)[6] and Westerns. Not all books within these genres are adventures. Adventure fiction takes the setting and premise of these other genres, but the fast-paced plot of an adventure focuses on the actions of the hero within the setting. See also pulp adventure .

All animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently, at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.

Anthropology;"Anthropology ( /ænθrɵˈpɒlədʒi/) is the study of humanity. It has origins in the humanities, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. The term ""anthropology"" is from the Greek anthrōpos (ἄνθρωπος), ""human being"", and -logia (-λογία), ""discourse"" or ""study"", and was first used in 1501 by German philosopher Magnus Hundt. Anthropology's basic concerns are ""What defines Homo sapiens?"", ""Who are the ancestors of modern Homo sapiens?"", ""What are humans' physical traits?"", ""How do humans behave?"", ""Why are there variations and differences among different groups of humans?"", ""How has the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens influenced its social organization and culture?"" and so forth. In the United States, contemporary anthropology is typically divided into four sub-fields: cultural anthropology also known as social anthropology, archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and physical (or biological) anthropology. The four-field approach to anthropology is reflected in many undergraduate textbooks as well as anthropology programs (e.g. Michigan, Berkeley, Penn). At universities in the United Kingdom, and much of Europe, these ""sub-fields"" are frequently housed in separate departments and are seen as distinct disciplines. The social and cultural sub-field has been heavily influenced by structuralist and post-modern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies (an arena more typically in the remit of sociologists). During the 1970s and 1990s there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline.During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology, biological anthropology, and linguistic anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, anthropology as a discipline has lacked cohesion over the last several decades. This has even led to departments diverging, for example in the 1998–9 academic year at Stanford University, where the ""scientists"" and ""non-scientists"" divided into two departments: anthropological sciences and cultural & social anthropology; these departments later reunified in the 2008–9 academic year."
Apocalyptic;Apocalyptic is from the word apocalypse, referring to the end of the world.

Naipaul was born in Trinidad, and Vladimir Nabokov was Russian, but all are considered important writers in the history of English literature. In other words, English literature is as diverse as the varieties and dialects of English spoken around the world. In academia, the term often labels departments and programmes practising English studies in secondary and tertiary educational systems. Despite the variety of authors of English literature, the works of William Shakespeare remain paramount throughout the English-speaking world."

Chapter Books;A chapter book is a story book intended for intermediate readers, generally age 7-10. Unlike picture books for younger readers, a chapter book tells the story primarily through prose, rather than pictures. Unlike books for older readers, chapter books contain plentiful illustrations. The name refers to the fact that the stories are usually divided into short chapters, which provide children with opportunities to stop and resume reading if their attention spans are not long enough to finish the book in one sitting. Chapter books are usually works of fiction of moderate length and complexity.
Chick Lit;Chick lit is genre fiction which addresses issues of modern womanhood, often humorously and lightheartedly.

Christian Fiction;A Christian novel is any novel that expounds and illustrates a Christian world view in its plot, its characters, or both, or which deals with Christian themes in a positive way.

Such a Christian novel does not have to involve an actual event or character in Bible history.
Christmas;"Christmas (Old English: Crīstesmæsse, meaning ""Christ's Mass"") is an annual commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ and a widely observed cultural holiday, celebrated generally on December 25 by billions of people around the world.

Christmas is a civil holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated by an increasing number of non-Christians, and is an integral part of the Christmas and holiday season."
Classics;"A classic stands the test of time. The work is usually considered to be a representation of the period in which it was written; and the work merits lasting recognition. In other words, if the book was published in the recent past, the work is not a classic. A classic has a certain universal appeal. Great works of literature touch us to our very core beings--partly because they integrate themes that are understood by readers from a wide range of backgrounds and levels of experience. Themes of love, hate, death, life, and faith touch upon some of our most basic emotional responses. Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature from all traditions, such as the Chinese classics or the Indian Vedas. Disambiguation: The study of ancient (""classical"") civilisations and languages, see Classical studies ."
Clean Romance;Romance books without intimacy details or foul language.
Comedy;In a modern sense, comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or to amuse by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece.

The subjects of coming-of-age stories are typically males in their mid teens, although sometimes females are the protagonists. Themes of maturation, acculturation, loss of innocence, wisdom and/or acumen, and worldliness are often present. Coming-of-age is a theme that fits multiple genres."

Cookbooks;Non-fiction books that contain a collection of recipes, techniques, and tricks of the trade or else focus on the exploration of food, cooking, and culture of food. Many cookbooks are divided into sections such as baking, dinner, and breakfast. A specialty cookbook may focus only on a certain country's cuisine, such as Italian or Cajun. There are some cookbooks that are written to highlight one ingredient (i.e. honey), and some cookbooks focused on only one branch of cooking (such as bread.) Even further, some cookbooks focus on types of cooking (microwave, barbecue, baking.)
Cozy Mystery;Cozies very rarely focus on sex, profanity or violence. The murders take place off stage, and are often relatively bloodless (e.g. poisoning), while sexual activity (if any) between characters is only ever gently implied and never directly addressed. The cozy mystery usually takes place in a small town or village. The small size of the setting makes it believable that all the suspects know each other. The amateur sleuth is usually a very likeable person who is able to get the community members to talk freely about each other. There is usually at least one very knowledgeable, nosy, yet reliable character in the book who is able to fill in all of the blanks, thus enabling the amateur sleuth to solve the case.
~~~~~~~~~~Crafts Hobbies;

Dark Fantasy;"At its most basic, dark fantasy is a term used to describe a fantasy story with a pronounced horror element. A stricter definition is difficult to pin down, as authors, publishers, and readers have used ""dark fantasy"" in various contexts throughout the years. Dark fantasy is often used as a synonym for supernatural horror. Some authors and critics also apply the term to high fantasy stories that feature anti-heroic or morally ambiguous protagonists. Fantasy works by writers typically associated with the horror genre are sometimes described as ""dark fantasy."" Conversely, the term is also used to describe ""darker"" works by authors best-known for other styles of fantasy."

Death;The cessation of life.
Demons;"In Ancient Near Eastern religions as well as in the derived Abrahamic traditions, including ancient and medieval Christian demonology, a demon is considered an ""unclean spirit"" which may cause demonic possession, to be addressed with an act of exorcism. In Western occultism and Renaissance magic, which grew out of an amalgamation of Greco-Roman magic, Jewish demonology and Christian tradition, a demon is a spiritual entity that may be conjured and controlled. Many of the demons in literature were once fallen angels. In general fiction, demons tend to be creatures from Hell, often Satan's minions, who bring misfortune to humans."

~~~~~~~~~~To ni žanr, ampak zbirka????Dragonlance;Dragonlance is a shared universe created by Laura and Tracy Hickman, and expanded by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis under the direction of TSR, Inc. into a series of popular fantasy novels. The Hickmans conceived Dragonlance while driving in their car on the way to TSR for a job interview. At TSR Tracy met Margaret Weis, his future writing partner, and they gathered a group of associates to play the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. The adventures during that game inspired a series of gaming modules, a series of novels, licensed products such as board games, and lead miniature figures.
Dragons;Dragons are legendary creatures, typically with serpentine or otherwise reptilian traits, that feature in the myths of many cultures. There are two distinct cultural traditions of dragons: the European dragon, derived from European folk traditions and ultimately related to Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies, and the Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan, Korea and other Asian countries. The traditional European dragon is a large reptilian creature with wings who lives in underground caves filled with treasure. They can breathe fire. Chinese dragons are more serpentine in shape who possess four legs and no wings. They are often considered signs of good luck, power and strength. Dragons vary drastically according to different stories and mythology. Some can talk and perform magic. Some can assume human form. Some are affiliated with non-fire elements and can breathe ice, lightning and other elements.
Drama;"Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning ""action"" (Classical Greek: δρᾶμα, drama), which is derived from ""to do"" or ""to act"" (Classical Greek: δράω, draō). The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception."
~~~~~~~~~~~~Dungeons and Dragons;Dungeons & Dragons novels are works of fantasy fiction that are based upon campaign settings released for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game.
Dystopia;Dystopia is a form of literature that explores social and political structures. It is a creation of a nightmare world - unlike its opposite, Utopia, which is an ideal world. Dystopia is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. It often features different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions, and a state of constant warfare or violence. Many novels combine both Dystopia and Utopia, often as a metaphor for the different directions humanity can take in its choices, ending up with one of the two possible futures.

As a genre, spy fiction is thematically related to the novel of adventure, the thriller and the politico–military thriller.
European Literature;"European literature refers to the literature of Europe. European literature includes literature in many languages; among the most important of the modern written works are those in English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Polish, German, Italian, Modern Greek, Czech, Russian, Bosnian and works by the Scandinavians and Irish. Important classical and medieval traditions are those in Latin, Ancient Greek, Old Norse, Medieval French and the Italian Tuscan dialect of the renaissance.

Fairies;A fairy (also faery, faerie, fay, fae) is a type of mythical being or legendary creature, a form of spirit, often described as metaphysical, supernatural or preternatural.
Fairy Tales;"Fairy tale is a type of short narrative that typically features such folkloric characters, such as fairies, goblins, elves, trolls, dwarves, giants or gnomes, and usually magic or enchantments. However, only a small number of the stories thus designated explicitly refer to fairies. Fairy tales are high fantasy based on stories that are not only not true, but that couldn't possibly be true, while Legends are sometimes perceived as real or plausible. Fairy tales may merge into legends, where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth. However, unlike legends and epics, they usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and actual places, people, and events; they take place once upon a time rather than in actual times. See also fairies ."
Family;A family is a group of people related to each other by genetic ties, adoption, marriage, or co-residence. Literature about the family tends to focus on the relationships between family members.
Fan Fiction;"Fan fiction, or fanfiction (often abbreviated as fan fic, fanfic, or simply fic), is a broadly defined fan labor term for stories about characters or settings written by fans of the original work, rather than by the original creator. Works of fan fiction are rarely commissioned or authorized by the original work's owner, creator, or publisher; also, they are almost never professionally published. Due to these works' not being published, stories often contain a disclaimer stating that the creator of the work owns none of the original characters. Fan fiction is defined by being both related to its subject's canonical fictional universe and simultaneously existing outside the canon of that universe. Most fan fiction writers assume that their work is read primarily by other fans, and therefore tend to presume that their readers have knowledge of the canon universe (created by a professional writer) in which their works are based. Goodreads allows fanfiction that is completed, self-published, and preferably book-length (refer to the manual, or the Goodreads Librarians Group for more info)."
Fantasy Romance;"Romantic fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy fiction, describing a fantasy story using many of the elements and conventions of the romance genre. One of the key features of romantic fantasy involves the focus on relationships, social, political, and romantic. Romantic fantasy has been published by both fantasy lines and romance lines. Some publishers distinguish between ""romantic fantasy"" where the romance is most important and ""fantasy romance"" where the fantasy elements are most important. Others say that ""the borderline between fantasy romance and romantic fantasy has essentially ceased to exist, or if it's still there, it's moving back and forth constantly""."
Fantasy;Fantasy is a genre that uses magic and other supernatural forms as a primary element of plot, theme, and/or setting. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of technological and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (collectively known as speculative fiction or science fiction/fantasy ) In its broadest sense, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today, including young adults, most of whom are represented by the works below.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Favorites;A subjective genre for books people consider to be their favorites.
Feminism;Feminism is a collection of movements and ideologies aimed at defining, establishing, and defending equal political, economic, and social justice for women. A fundamental concept underlying feminism is that women are an oppressed group, a reality that feminism seeks to highlight and fight against. Books tagged 'Feminism' deal, directly or indirectly, with feminist philosophy. See also gender studies .
Fiction;"Fiction is the telling of stories which are not real. More specifically, fiction is an imaginative form of narrative, one of the four basic rhetorical modes. Although the word fiction is derived from the Latin fingo, fingere, finxi, fictum, ""to form, create"", works of fiction need not be entirely imaginary and may include real people, places, and events. Fiction may be either written or oral. Although not all fiction is necessarily artistic, fiction is largely perceived as a form of art or entertainment. The ability to create fiction and other artistic works is considered to be a fundamental aspect of human culture, one of the defining characteristics of humanity."
France;Books that are set in France.
Lgbt;"LGBT is an initialism that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism LGB, which was used to replace the term gay in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s. The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures. It may be used to refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996. Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI. Some people combine the two acronyms and use the term LGBTIQ. Others use LGBT+ to encompass a spectrum of gender and sexuality. There is also a rise in the use of the acronym QUILTBAG to encompass either ""Asexual"" or ""Ally"" as the A, and the G to cover both the more usual ""Gay"" as well as ""Gender-Questioning""/""Gender-Queer""."
German Literature;German literature comprises those literary texts written in the German language. This includes literature written in Germany, Austria, the German part of Switzerland, and to a lesser extent works of the German diaspora. German literature of the modern period is mostly in Standard German, but there are some currents of literature influenced to a greater or lesser degree by dialects (e.g. Alemannic). An early flowering of German literature is the Middle High German period of the High Middle Ages. Modern literature in German begins with the authors of the Enlightenment (such as Herder) and reaches its classical form at the turn of the 18th century with Weimar Classicism (Goethe and Schiller).
Ghost Stories;"Ghost stories deal with subjects and situations focusing on hauntings, spirits, and interactions with the dead. These may be in the form of fiction or non-fiction. Haunting is used as a plot device in horror fiction and paranormal-based fiction. Legends about haunted houses have long appeared in literature. For example, the Arabian Nights tale of ""Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad"" revolves around a house haunted by jinns. The influence of the Arabian Nights on modern horror fiction is certainly discernable in the work of H. P. Lovecraft. In his early years as a child, he would imagine himself living the adventures of the heroes in the book, and it inspired him to create his famed Necronomicon."
Gothic;Gothic fiction is a genre of literature that combines elements of both the uncanny and romance. As a genre, it is generally believed to have been invented by the English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto. Gothic fiction is considered to be the parent genre for both Horror and Mystery , among other genres. The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. Melodrama and parody (including self-parody) were other long-standing features of the Gothic initiated by Walpole. Gothic literature is intimately associated with the Gothic Revival architecture of the same era. In a way similar to the gothic revivalists' rejection of the clarity and rationalism of the neoclassical style of the Enlightened Establishment, the literary Gothic embodies an appreciation of the joys of extreme emotion, the thrills of fearfulness and awe inherent in the sublime, and a quest for atmosphere. The ruins of gothic buildings gave rise to multiple linked emotions by representing the inevitable decay and collapse of human creations — thus the urge to add fake ruins as eye catchers in English landscape parks. English Gothic writers often associated medieval buildings with what they saw as a dark and terrifying period, characterized by harsh laws enforced by torture, and with mysterious, fantastic, and superstitious rituals. In literature such anti-Catholicism had a European dimension featuring Roman Catholic excesses such as the Inquisition (in southern European countries such as Italy and Spain). Prominent features of Gothic fiction include terror (both psychological and physical), mystery, the supernatural, ghosts, haunted houses and Gothic architecture, castles, darkness, death, decay, doubles, madness, secrets, and hereditary curses. The stock characters of Gothic fiction include tyrants, villains, bandits, maniacs, Byronic heroes, persecuted maidens, femmes fatales, monks, nuns, madwomen, magicians, vampires, werewolves, monsters, demons, angels, fallen angels, revenants, ghosts, perambulating skeletons, the Wandering Jew and the Devil himself.
Graphic Novels;A graphic novel is a narrative work in which the story is conveyed to the reader using sequential art in either an experimental design or in a traditional comics format. The term is employed in a broad manner, encompassing non-fiction works and thematically linked short stories as well as fictional stories across a number of genres. -- from Wikipedia
Hard Science Fiction;Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific or technical detail, or on scientific accuracy, or on both. It is characterized by rigorous attention to accurate detail in the natural sciences, especially physics, astrophysics, and chemistry, or on accurately depicting worlds that more advanced technology may make possible. Hard science fiction is driven more by ideas than characterization. Plausible science and technology are central to the plot.
Health;
Heroic Fantasy;Heroic fantasy is a sub-genre of fantasy which chronicles the tales of heroes in imaginary lands. Characteristics: Frequently, the protagonist is reluctant to be a champion, and/or is of low or humble origin, may have royal ancestors or parents but does not know it. Though events are usually beyond their control, they are thrust into positions of great responsibility where their mettle is tested in a number of spiritual and physical challenges. Although it shares many of the basic themes of Sword and Sorcery the term 'Heroic fantasy' is often used to avoid the garish overtones of the former.
High Fantasy;"High fantasy is defined as fantasy fiction set in an alternative, entirely fictional (""secondary"") world, rather than the real, or ""primary"" world. The secondary world is usually internally consistent but its rules differ in some way(s) from those of the primary world. By contrast, low fantasy is characterized by being set in the primary, or ""real"" world, or a rational and familiar fictional world, with the inclusion of magical elements."
Historical Fantasy;"Historical fantasy is a subgenre of historical fiction that incorporates fantastic elements (such as magic) into the narrative. There is much crossover with other subgenres of fantasy; those classes as Arthurian, Celtic, or Dark Ages could just as easily be placed in Historical Fantasy. Stories fitting this classification generally take place prior to the 20th century."
Historical Fiction;Historical fiction presents a story set in the past, often during a significant time period. In historical fiction, the time period is an important part of the setting and often of the story itself. Historical fiction may include fictional characters, well-known historical figures or a mixture of the two. Authors of historical fiction usually pay close attention to the details of their stories (settings, clothing, dialogue, etc.) to ensure that they fit the time periods in which the narratives take place. In some historical fiction, famous events appear from points of view not recorded in history, showing historical figures dealing with actual events while depicting them in a way that is not recorded in history. Other times, the historical event or time period complements a story's narrative, forming a framework and background for the characters' lives. Sometimes, historical fiction can be for the most part true, but the names of people and places have been in some way altered. As this is fiction, artistic license is permitted in regard to presentation and subject matter, so long as it does not deviate in significant ways from established history. If events should deviate significantly, the story may then fall into the genre of alternate history , which is known for speculating on what could have happened if a significant historical event had gone differently. On a similar note, events occurring in historical fiction must adhere to the laws of physics. Stories that extend into the magical or fantastic are often considered historical fantasy. See also historical romance .
Historical Romance;"Historical romance (also historical novel) is a broad category of fiction in which the plot takes place in a setting located in the past. Walter Scott helped popularise this genre in the early 19th-century, with works such as Rob Roy and Ivanhoe. Literary fiction historical romances continue to be published, and a notable recent example is Wolf Hall (2009), a multi-award winning novel by English historical novelist Hilary Mantel. It is also a genre of mass-market fiction, which is related to the broader romantic love genre. The terms ""romance novel"" and ""historical romance"" are ambiguous, because the word ""romance"", and the associated word ""romantic"", have a number of different meanings. In particular, on the one hand there is the mass-market genre of ""fiction dealing with love"", harlequin romance, and on the other hand, ""a romance"" can also be defined as ""a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents"". However, many romances, including the historical romances of Walter Scott, are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a ""kindred term"". To add to the confusion literary fiction romances, for example Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights, often have a strong love story interest. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: ""a novel is le roman, der Roman, il romanzo."""

Holiday;Books that are set during a holiday season or celebrate something about a particular holiday. Can fit under any genre.
Horror;"Horror fiction is fiction in any medium intended to scare, unsettle, or horrify the audience. Historically, the cause of the ""horror"" experience has often been the intrusion of a supernatural element into everyday human experience. Since the 1960s, any work of fiction with a morbid, gruesome, surreal, or exceptionally suspenseful or frightening theme has come to be called ""horror"". Horror fiction often overlaps science fiction or fantasy, all three of which categories are sometimes placed under the umbrella classification speculative fiction."
Horses;Horses have been domesticated by humans for thousands of years. Once used for transportation, hauling, and war, they are now kept mostly for sports, recreation, and companionship. See also horse racing .
Humor;A comic novel is usually a work of fiction in which the writer seeks to amuse the reader, sometimes with subtlety and as part of a carefully woven narrative, sometimes above all other considerations. It could indeed be said that comedy fiction is literary work that aims primarily to provoke laughter, but this isn't always as obvious as it first may seem.
India;Books that are set in India.
Ireland;Books that are set in Ireland.
Italy;Books set in Italy
Japan;Books that are set in Japan.
Japanese Literature;Early works of Japanese literature were heavily influenced by cultural contact with China and Chinese literature, often written in Classical Chinese. Indian literature also had an influence through the diffusion of Buddhism in Japan. Eventually, Japanese literature developed into a separate style in its own right as Japanese writers began writing their own works about Japan, although the influence of Chinese literature and Classical Chinese remained until the end of the Edo period. Since Japan reopened its ports to Western trading and diplomacy in the 19th century, Western and Eastern literature have strongly affected each other and continue to do so.
Journalism;reporting on news and current events
Lds;LDS is the common name for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon church.
Light Novel;A light novel (or Ranobe) is a style of Japanese novel typically not more than 40-50,000 words long, usually published in bunkobon size, and are often illustrated. The text is often serialized in anthology magazines prior to collection in book form.
Literary Fiction;"Literary fiction is a term that has come into common usage in the early 1960s. The term is principally used to distinguish ""serious fiction"" which is a work that claims to hold literary merit, in comparison from genre fiction and popular fiction. The name literature is sometimes used for this genre, although it can also refer to a broader category of writing."
Literature;"Literature is the art of written works. The two most basic written literary categories include fiction and non-fiction , although ""literature"" in popular use can also mean a sub-genre of fiction called literary fiction ."
Magic;These are all books that deal with magic: wands, spells, curses, potions, hexes, thoughts (mind-magic), art, symbols, rituals, magical languages, witchcraft, etc. See also magick for non-fiction.
Magical Realism;"Magical realism is a fiction genre in which magical elements blend to create a realistic atmosphere that accesses a deeper understanding of reality. The story explains these magical elements as normal occurrences, presented in a straightforward manner that places the ""real"" and the ""fantastic"" in the same stream of thought."
Manga;Japanese or Japanese-influenced comics and graphic novels. Usually printed in black-and-white. There are many genres inside manga, the most distinct being shojo (for girls) and shonen (for boys). See also the compound shelves: * graphic novels, comics, and manga * graphic novels and manga * comics and manga
~~~~~~~~~plis no...Manhwa;Manhwa is the general Korean term for comics and print cartoons (common usage also includes animated cartoons). Outside of Korea, the term usually refers specifically to South Korean comics.
Mathematics;Mathematics (from Greek μάθημα máthēma, “knowledge, study, learning”) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. Mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.
Media Tie In;Books which are related to stories in other media such as television or movies.
Medieval;The Medieval period is subdivided into the Early (c. 476-1000), the High (c. 1001-1300), and the Late (c. 1301–1500) Middle Ages. Historical fiction novels set within this time-frame in Europe are labelled medieval. Medieval Europe offers the historical backdrop of the grandeur of medieval royalty contrasted with the stark struggle for survival of the common folk. Medieval historical fiction features, among others, conflicts between Christianity and the remnants of paganism, the open warfare of the Crusades, the medieval Celts, Anglo-Saxon and Norman England, the Wars of the Roses, the Vikings and the Byzantine Empire.
Memoir;"As a literary genre, a memoir (from the French: mémoire from the Latin memoria, meaning ""memory"", or a reminiscence), forms a subclass of autobiography – although the terms 'memoir' and 'autobiography' are almost interchangeable in modern parlance. Memoir is autobiographical writing, but not all autobiographical writing follows the criteria for memoir. Memoirs are structured differently from formal autobiographies which tend to encompass the writer's entire life span, focusing on the development of his/her personality. The chronological scope of memoir is determined by the work's context and is therefore more focused and flexible than the traditional arc of birth to childhood to old age as found in an autobiography. Memoirs tended to be written by politicians or people in court society, later joined by military leaders and businessmen, and often dealt exclusively with the writer's careers rather than their private life. Historically, memoirs have dealt with public matters, rather than personal. Many older memoirs contain little or no information about the writer, and are almost entirely concerned with other people. Modern expectations have changed this, even for heads of government. Like most autobiographies, memoirs are generally written from the first person point of view. Gore Vidal, in his own memoir Palimpsest, gave a personal definition: ""a memoir is how one remembers one's own life, while an autobiography is history, requiring research, dates, facts double-checked."" It is more about what can be gleaned from a section of one's life than about the outcome of the life as a whole. Humorist Will Rogers put it a little more pithily: ""Memoirs means when you put down the good things you ought to have done and leave out the bad ones you did do."""
Mermaids;A legendary sea creature having the head and upper body of a woman and the tail of a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover.
Metaphysics;Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of being and the world. Topics of metaphysical investigation include existence, objects and their properties, space and time, cause and effect, and possibility. A central branch of metaphysics is ontology, the investigation into the basic categories of being and how they relate to one another. Another central branch is metaphysical cosmology: which seeks to understand the origin and meaning of the universe by thought alone.
Military Fiction;Military fiction mainly deals with military operations, adventures, memoirs etc. by country's military wing - army, air force or navy. It has few sub-genres like military thriller, military historical fiction, military science fiction etc. Military fiction may have an angle of civilian intelligence agencies but the majority of plot revolves around military operations or situations. Earlier a sub-genre of the espionage fiction/thriller genre, military fiction is becoming an independent genre of its own. Some famous authors include Tom Clancy, Harry Patterson (pseudonym Jack Higgins), Alistair MacLean, Stephen Coonts, Dale Brown, W.E.B. Griffin, Harold Coyle etc.
Military History;See also history . Military history is a humanities discipline within the scope of general historical recording of armed conflict in the history of humanity, and its impact on the societies, their cultures, economies and changing intra and international relationships.

~~~~~~~~~Multi Genre;
Music;Books about music history, music genres and musicians.
Mystery Thriller;Mystery-thrillers are stories with twists and turns that keep you on your toes guessing about the truth, the POV's truth, and about what will happen next. They can be written from a hero's POV or from a sinister character's POV. Some are scary and make your heart beat faster, making it hard to put down. Some stories make you laugh if you have a witty writer with an unusual sense of humor easy to relate to. Both types can be hard to put down when they're page turners. And you can find many page turners among a variety of styles and writers, depending on what seeks your fancy. See also mystery .
Mystery;"Mystery fiction is a loosely-defined term that is often used as a synonym of detective fiction — in other words a novel or short story in which a detective (either professional or amateur) solves a crime. The term ""mystery fiction"" may sometimes be limited to the subset of detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle element and its logical solution (cf. whodunit), as a contrast to hardboiled detective stories which focus on action and gritty realism. However, in more general usage ""mystery"" may be used to describe any form of crime fiction, even if there is no mystery to be solved. For example, the Mystery Writers of America describes itself as ""the premier organization for mystery writers, professionals allied to the crime writing field, aspiring crime writers, and those who are devoted to the genre"". Although normally associated with the crime genre, the term ""mystery fiction"" may in certain situations refer to a completely different genre, where the focus is on supernatural mystery (even if no crime is involved). This usage was common in the pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s, where titles such as Dime Mystery, Thrilling Mystery and Spicy Mystery offered what at the time were described as ""weird menace"" stories – supernatural horror in the vein of Grand Guignol. This contrasted with parallel titles such as Dime Detective, Thrilling Detective and Spicy Detective, which contained conventional hardboiled crime fiction. The first use of ""mystery"" in this sense was by Dime Mystery, which started out as an ordinary crime fiction magazine but switched to ""weird menace"" during the latter part of 1933."
Mythology;"The term mythology can refer to a body of myths or to any traditional story. A myth is a sacred narrative explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form. The main characters in myths are usually gods or supernatural heroes. The study of myth began in ancient history. Rival classes of the Greek myths by Euhemerus, Plato and Sallustius were developed by the Neoplatonists and later revived by Renaissance mythographers. The nineteenth-century comparative mythology reinterpreted myth as a primitive and failed counterpart of science (Tylor), a ""disease of language"" (Müller), or a misinterpretation of magical ritual (Frazer)."
New Adult;New Adult fiction bridges the gap between Young Adult and Adult genres. It typically features protagonists between the ages of 18 and 25 with the cap at 30ish. The genre tends to focus on issues prevalent in the young adult genre as well as focusing on issues experienced by individuals between the area of childhood and adulthood, such as leaving home for university and getting a job. New adult is typically considered a subcategory of adult literature rather than young adult literature. Some popular new adult titles include The Magicians by Lev Grossman, A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas, Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire and Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell.
Nonfiction;"Non-fiction is an account or representation of a subject which is presented as fact. This presentation may be accurate or not; that is, it can give either a true or a false account of the subject in question. However, it is generally assumed that the authors of such accounts believe them to be truthful at the time of their composition. Note that reporting the beliefs of others in a nonfiction format is not necessarily an endorsement of the ultimate veracity of those beliefs, it is simply saying that it is true that people believe that (for such topics as mythology, religion). Non-fiction can also be written about fiction, giving information about these other works. Non-fiction is one of the two main divisions in writing, particularly used in libraries, the other being fiction. However, non-fiction need not be written text necessarily, since pictures and film can also purport to present a factual account of a subject."
Novella;A novella is a written, fictional and prose narrative, usually longer than a novelette but shorter than a novel. A novella generally features fewer conflicts than a novel, yet more complicated ones than a short story. The conflicts also have more time to develop than in short stories. They have endings that are located at the brink of change. Unlike novels, they are not divided into chapters, and are often intended to be read at a single sitting, as the short story, although white space is often used to divide the sections. They maintain, therefore, a single effect. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America Nebula Awards for science fiction define the novella as having a word count between 17,500 and 40,000. Other definitions start as low as 10,000 words and run as high as 70,000 words.
Novels;A novel is a long prose narrative that usually describes fictional characters and events in the form of a sequential story. It rests on the consensus that the novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose, followed by the novella, novelette and the short story. However, there is no consensus as to the minimal required lenght. In part because of this wide variation, the boundary between a novella and a novel may be arbitrary and difficult to determine. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America specifies a word length of over 40,000 words for a novel, while National Novel Writing Month requires its novels to be at least 50,000 words.
~~~~~~~~~~~Outdoors Nature;
Paganism;Paganism is an umbrella term for a variety of religions, many of which are polytheistic or pantheistic. Some are attempts to reconstruct ancient religions, while others are quite recent. A few examples of Pagan religions are Wicca, Celtic Reconstructionism, and Asatru.
Paranormal Fantasy;"Fantasy that makes use of elements that fall outside the realm of 'normal' experience and scientific explanation; these elements are often described as paranormal, occult, supernatural, mystical, etc. Examples include (but are not limited to): ghosts, vampires, werewolves, witches, demons."
Paranormal Romance;Paranormal romance is a sub-genre of the romance novel related to paranormal fiction . Paranormal romance focuses on romance and includes elements beyond the range of scientific explanation, blending together themes from the genres of urban fantasy, traditional fantasy, science fiction, or horror. Paranormal romance may range from traditional category romances with a paranormal setting to stories where the main emphasis is on a science fiction or fantasy based plot with a romantic subplot included. Paranormal romance stories tend to feature a lot of romance, suspense and action, as well as sometimes include mystery, humor and/or horror in the plotline. Common hallmarks are romantic relationships between humans, vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters, fairies, demons, witches, sorcerers, ghosts, and other entities of a supernatural or otherworldly nature. Beyond the more prevalent themes involving vampires, shapeshifters, or time travel, paranormal romances can also include books featuring characters with psychic abilities, like telekinesis or telepathy. “Paranormal Romance: Romance novels in which the future, a fantasy world, or paranormal happenings are an integral part of the plot.” See also: * erotic paranormal romance * paranormal
Paranormal;Paranormal books involve unusual experiences that lack a scientific explanation. Some popular subjects in paranormal books are supernatural creatures, ESP, clairvoyance, ghosts, UFOs, telepathy, and psychics. A subgenre of paranormal books and of romances is paranormal romance . These books focus mainly on the romantic relationships with a background theme of vampires, shapeshifters, ghosts, time travel, fantastical beings, and psychic abilities.
~~~~~~Personal Development;Personal development covers activities that improve awareness and identity, develop talents and potential, build human capital and facilitate employability, enhance quality of life and contribute to the realization of dreams and aspirations. Not limited to self-help, the concept involves formal and informal activities for developing others in roles such as teacher, guide, counselor, manager, life coach or mentor. When personal development takes place in the context of institutions, it refers to the methods, programs, tools, techniques, and assessment systems that support human development at the individual level in organizations.
Philosophy;"Philosophy is the study of general problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, truth, beauty, justice, validity, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these questions (such as mysticism or mythology) by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument. The word philosophy is of Ancient Greek origin: φιλοσοφία (philosophía), meaning ""love of wisdom."""
Picture Books;A picture book combines visual and verbal narratives in a book format, most often aimed at young children. The images in picture books use a range of media such as oil paints, acrylics, watercolor and pencil. Two of the earliest books with something like the format picture books still retain now were Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter from 1845 and Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Peter Rabbit from 1902. Some of the best-known picture books are Robert McCloskey's Make Way for Ducklings, Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat, and Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are. The Caldecott Medal (established 1938) and Kate Greenaway Medal (established 1955) are awarded annually for illustrations in children's literature. From the mid-1960s onward, several other children's literature awards began to include a category for picture books.
Pirates;"Fiction or non-fiction books involving pirates. Those who engage in acts of robbery or criminal violence at sea are called pirates. Piracy has existed from ancient times to the modern day, but much literature focuses on the ""Golden Age of Piracy"" from about the 1650s to the 1730s."
Plays;A play is a form of literature written by a playwright, usually consisting of scripted dialogue between characters, intended for theatrical performance rather than just reading.
Poetry;Poetry is a form of literary art in which language is used for its aesthetic and evocative qualities in addition to, or in lieu of, its apparent meaning. Poetry may be written independently, as discrete poems, or may occur in conjunction with other arts, as in poetic drama, hymns or lyrics. Poetry, and discussions of it, have a long history. Early attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy.[1] Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition and rhyme, and emphasised the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from prose.[2] From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more loosely defined as a fundamental creative act using language.[3] Poetry often uses particular forms and conventions to expand the literal meaning of the words, or to evoke emotional or sensual responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. Poetry's use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor and simile create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm. Some forms of poetry are specific to particular cultures and genres, responding to the characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. While readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as being written in rhyming lines and regular meter, there are traditions, such as those of Du Fu and Beowulf, that use other approaches to achieve rhythm and euphony. In today's globalized world, poets often borrow styles, techniques and forms from diverse cultures and languages.
Politics;"Politics (from Greek πολιτικός, ""of, for, or relating to citizens""), is a process by which groups of people make collective decisions. The term is generally applied to the art or science of running governmental or state affairs. It also refers to behavior within civil governments. However, politics can be observed in other group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. It consists of ""social relations involving authority or power"" and refers to the regulation of public affairs within a political unit, and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply policy."
Post Apocalyptic;Post-apocalyptic fiction is set in a world or civilization after such a disaster. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between this form of science fiction and that which deals with dystopias. Also see Apocalyptic
Princesses;Books that involves princesses (usually as protagonists).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~Professional Technical;
Psychology;"Books that involve psychology; the study of mental processes and human behavior."
Pulp;"Pulp fiction can be characterized as ""fast-paced, plot-oriented storytelling of a linear nature with clearly defined, larger than life protagonists and antagonists, creative descriptions, clever use of turns of phrase and other aspects of writing that add to the intensity and pacing of the story."" The earliest pulp stories were printed in pulp magazines from 1896 through the 1950s. The term pulp derives from the cheap wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed. Magazines printed on higher quality paper were called ""glossies"" or ""slicks"". Pulp were most often priced at ten cents per magazine, while competing slicks were 25 cents apiece. Pulps were the successor to the penny dreadfuls, dime novels, and short fiction magazines of the 19th century. Although many respected writers wrote for pulps, the magazines are often remembered for their lurid and exploitative stories and sensational cover art. Modern superhero comic books are sometimes considered descendants of ""hero pulps""; pulp magazines often featured illustrated novel-length stories of heroic characters, such as The Shadow, Doc Savage and The Phantom Detective. The term pulp fiction can also refer to mass market paperbacks since the 1950s by publishers such as Ace, Dell, and Avon. After the year 2000, several small independent publishers released magazines which published short fiction, either short stories or novel-length presentations, in the tradition of the pulp magazines of the early 20th century. This ""New Pulp"" is fiction written with the same sensibilities, linear storytelling, pattern of conflict, and phrases of original Pulp, but crafted by modern writers, artists, and publishers. These new stories are either completely original characters or new tales of established characters from Pulp past. In addition, many books and stories are categorized as ""pulp"" or ""in the pulp style"" by readers and reviewers, even if not marketed as such by the publisher."
Queer;"Queer is an umbrella term for sexual and gender minorities that are not heterosexual or cisgender. Originally meaning ""strange"" or ""peculiar"", queer came to be deployed pejoratively against those with same-sex desires or relationships in the late-19th century. Beginning in the late-1980s, queer scholars and activists began to reclaim the word to establish community and assert a politicized identity distinct from the gay political identity. Queer identitites may be adopted by those who reject traditional gender identities and seek a broader, less conformist, and deliberately ambiguous alternative to the label LGBT."
~~~~~~mejbi Classics~~~~~~~~~~Read For School;Any books read by students as part of a school curriculum. See also high school .
Realistic Fiction;Realistic Fiction seems like real life, with characters dealing with real life problems. The plot often takes place in the present time. The situations are true or could be, but the main characters are fictional.
Reference;"A reference, is derived from Middle English referren, from Middle French rèférer, from Latin referre, ""to carry back"" formed from a prefix re- and ferre, ""to bear"". A large number of words derive from this root, including referee, reference, referendum, all retaining the basic meaning of the original Latin as ""a point, place or source of origin"" that something of comparable nature can be defined in terms of. A referee is the provider of this source of origin, and a referent is the possessor of the source of origin, whether it is knowledge, matter or energy. Because of its meaning, the word reference is use in every sphere of human knowledge, adopting shades of meaning particular to the contexts in which it is used. A references can take on many forms, including: a thought, a sensory perception that is audible (onomatopoeia), visual (text), olfactory, or tactile, emotional state, relationship with other, spacetime coordinate, symbolic or alpha-numeric, a physical object or an energy projection; but, other concrete and abstract contexts exist as methods of defining references within the scope of the various fields that require an origin, point of departure, or an original form. This includes methods that intentionally hide the reference from some observers, as in cryptography. The following sections give specific usages of reference in different subjects."
Regency;"Regency literature is generally set during the period of the English Regency or early 19th century. Rather than simply being versions of contemporary stories transported to a historical setting, Regency novels are a distinct genre with their own plot and stylistic conventions that derive from the works of Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer, and from the fiction genre known as the novel of manners. In particular, most Regencies feature a great deal of intelligent, fast-paced dialog between the protagonists and (traditionally) very little explicit sex or discussion of sex. Other common elements of Regency romances include mystery or farce elements in the plot; references to the Ton (le bon ton); a secondary romance between another couple in addition to the more serious story involving the main protagonists; mistaken identity (deliberate or otherwise); false engagements; marriages of convenience; depictions of activities common during the social season such as balls, routs, carriage riding, theatre events, fittings, suppers, assemblies, etc.; references to, or descriptions of, leisure activities engaged in by fashionable young men of the period, including riding, driving, boxing, gambling, fencing, shooting, etc."
Spirituality;Spirituality may refer to almost any kind of meaningful activity, personal growth, or blissful experience. Traditionally, spirituality refers to a process of re-formation of the personality but there is no precise definition of spirituality.
Religion;Religion is a cultural system that establishes symbols that relate humanity to spirituality and moral values. Many religions have narratives, symbols, traditions and sacred histories that are intended to give meaning to life or to explain the origin of life or the universe. They tend to derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle from their ideas about the cosmos and human nature.
Retellings;A new version of an older story. Sometimes, a fairy tale or myth may be reimagined with a modernized setting or retold from a minor character's perspective.
Roman;"""Roman"" may be used as the French word for novel, or in English to label books from or about Ancient Rome."
Romance;"According to the Romance Writers of America, ""Two basic elements comprise every romance novel: a central love story and an emotionally-satisfying and optimistic ending."" Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Other definitions of a romance novel may be broader, including other plots and endings or more than two people, or narrower, restricting the types of romances or conflicts."
Romantic Suspense;Romantic suspense is any genre romance that features a prominent mystery, suspense or thriller plot.
Russia;Books that are set in or about Russia and Russians.
School Stories;Books set at school, typically centering on pre-adolescent and adolescent school life. School stories are frequently set in boarding schools, often single-sex, and focus largely on friendship and loyalty between pupils. See also academic .
Science Fiction Romance;A subgenre of Romance, a futuristic form of romance.
Science Fiction;"Science fiction (abbreviated SF or sci-fi with varying punctuation and capitalization) is a broad genre of fiction that often involves speculations based on current or future science or technology. Science fiction is found in books, art, television, films, games, theatre, and other media. In organizational or marketing contexts, science fiction can be synonymous with the broader definition of speculative fiction , encompassing creative works incorporating imaginative elements not found in contemporary reality; this includes fantasy , horror and related genres. Although the two genres are often conflated as science fiction/fantasy , science fiction differs from fantasy in that, within the context of the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated laws of nature (though some elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation). Exploring the consequences of such differences is the traditional purpose of science fiction, making it a ""literature of ideas"". Science fantasy is largely based on writing entertainingly and rationally about alternate possibilities in settings that are contrary to known reality."
Science;Science (from the Latin scientia , meaning “knowledge”) is the effort to discover, and increase human understanding of how the physical world works. Through controlled methods, science uses observable physical evidence of natural phenomena to collect data, and analyzes this information to explain what and how things work.
Self Help;"Self-help, or self-improvement, is a self-guided improvement[1]—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial psychological basis. Many different self-help groupings exist and each has its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. ""Self-help culture, particularly Twelve-Step culture, has provided some of our most robust new language: recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency.""[2]"
Sequential Art;Sequential art refers to the art form of using a train of images deployed in sequence to tell a story or convey information. The best-known examples of sequential art are comics , graphic novels , and manga . See also the compound shelves: * graphic novels, comics, and manga * graphic novels and comics * graphic novels and manga * comics and manga
Shapeshifters;Shapeshifter fiction concerns men and women who are able to — or cursed to — periodically change into animal form or mimic other human appearances. Werewolf fiction is the most common variant of this sub-genre.
Short Stories;"A short story is a short work of prose fiction. It may be in any genre of fiction, and the exact definition of ""short"" will often depend on the genre. Short stories are often collected together with other short stories, poetry, art, and/or essays in order to form a larger book, although it is becoming more common for short stories to be released as stand-alone ebooks."
Sociology;Sociology is the study of society. It is a social science—a term with which it is sometimes synonymous—which uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop and refine a body of knowledge about human social activity, often with the goal of applying such knowledge to the pursuit of social welfare. Subject matter ranges from the micro level of agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and social structures. Sociology is both topically and methodologically a very broad discipline. Its traditional focuses have included social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularisation, law, and deviance. As all spheres of human activity are sculpted by social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to further subjects, such as health, military and penal institutions, the Internet, and even the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge. The range of social scientific methods has also broadly expanded. Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches to the analysis of society. Conversely, recent decades have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis.
Space Opera;Space opera is a subgenre of speculative fiction or science fiction that emphasizes romantic, often melodramatic adventure, set mainly or entirely in space, generally involving conflict between opponents possessing powerful (and sometimes quite fanciful) technologies and abilities. Perhaps the most significant trait of space opera is that settings, characters, battles, powers, and themes tend to be very large-scale. Also see Planetary Romance ,which has similarities.
Space;"""Space"" may refer to stories (usually science fiction ) which are set in outer space or it may refer to non-fiction about outer space (especially sciences such as astronomy )."
Speculative Fiction;Speculative fiction is a fiction genre speculating about worlds that are unlike the real world in various important ways. In these contexts, it generally overlaps one or more of the following: science fiction , fantasy fiction , horror fiction , supernatural fiction , superhero fiction , utopian and dystopian fiction, apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction, and alternate history . It is often used as an umbrella term for science fiction and fantasy considered as a single genre . The term is used this way in academic and ideological criticism of these genres, as well as by some readers, writers, and editors of these genres. The term is often attributed to Robert A. Heinlein . Some readers and writers of science fiction see the term as insulting towards science fiction, and therefore as having negative connotations.
Sports;"Sports : engagement in physical activity intended to create a benefit to the participant. Ranging from Amateur to Professional, from incompetent to proficient, for all levels of ability, all nations, all creeds, all genders. As James Joyce said ""I am, a stride at a time"""
Spy Thriller;Spy fiction, a genre of literature involving espionage as an important context or plot device, emerged in the early twentieth century, inspired by rivalries and intrigues between the major powers, and the establishment of modern intelligence agencies. It was given new impetus by the development of fascism and communism in the lead-up to World War 2, continued to develop during the Cold War, and received a fresh impetus from the emergence of rogue states, international criminal organizations, Muslim fundamentalism, global terrorist networks, maritime piracy and technological sabotage and espionage as potent threats to Western societies.
Steampunk;"Steampunk is a subgenre of speculative fiction, usually set in an anachronistic Victorian or quasi-Victorian alternate history setting. It could be described by the slogan ""What the past would look like if the future had happened sooner."" It includes fiction with science fiction, fantasy or horror themes. It is a subgenre of fantasy and speculative fiction that came into prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s. The term denotes works set in an era or world where STEAM POWER is still widely used—usually the 19th century, and often set in Victorian era England—but with prominent elements of either science fiction or fantasy, such as fictional technological inventions like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, or real technological developments like the computer occurring at an earlier date. Dieselpunk takes over where Steampunk leaves off. These are stories that take over as we usher in the machine-heavy eras of WWI and WWII. The use of diesel-powered machines plays heavily. In this (like its steam counterpart), the focus is on the technology."
Superheroes;Superhero fiction is a genre originating in and most common to American comic books, though it has expanded into other media through adaptations and original works. The form is a type of speculative fiction examining the adventures of costumed crime fighters known as superheroes, who often possess superhuman powers and battle similarly powered criminals known as supervillains.
Supernatural;"The supernatural genre is fiction about witches, vampires, ghosts, werewolves, shape shifters, demons, angels, or anything else in the paranormal or otherworldly realm. A sub-category is ""supernatural-romance"" in which the plot revolves around the main female character and the romance storyline. Also see Paranormal ."
Surrealism;"Surrealist works feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur; however, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact."
Survival;Fiction or non-fiction book focusing on a person or group of people who must brave the elements, natural disasters, weather or other circumstances in order to survive. A theme common when people are shipwrecked or survive plane crashes. Survival can also be in books where society has crumbled or deteriorated and people must survive the changed world in isolated groups.
Suspense;"Suspense is a feeling of uncertainty and anxiety about the outcome of certain actions, most often referring to an audience's perceptions in a dramatic work. Suspense is not exclusive to fiction, though. Suspense may operate in any situation where there is a lead up to a big event or dramatic moment, with tension being a primary emotion felt as part of the situation. In the kind of suspense described by film director Alfred Hitchcock, an audience experiences suspense when they expect something bad to happen and have (or believe they have) a superior perspective on events in the drama's hierarchy of knowledge, yet they are powerless to intervene to prevent it from happening. In broader definitions of suspense, this emotion arises when someone is aware of his lack of knowledge about the development of a meaningful event; thus, suspense is a combination of anticipation and uncertainty dealing with the obscurity of the future. In terms of narrative expectations, it may be contrasted with mystery or curiosity and surprise."
Sword and Sorcery;Sword and sorcery (S&S) is a fantasy subgenre generally characterized by swashbuckling heroes engaged in exciting and violent conflicts. An element of romance is often present, as is an element of magic and the supernatural. Unlike works of high fantasy, the tales, though dramatic, focus mainly on personal battles rather than world-endangering matters.
Theatre;"Theatre is a branch of the performing arts. Any performance may be considered theatre; however, as a performing art, theatre focuses almost exclusively on live performers enacting a self-contained drama before an audience. A performance qualifies as dramatic by creating a representational illusion. The word ""theatre"" derives from the Ancient Greek theatron (θέατρον) meaning ""a place for viewing."" A theatrical performance may include music, dance and various elements of stagecraft such as costumes, sets, lights, stage properties and sound engineering, among others. Modern Western theatre derives in large measure from ancient Greek drama, from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters, and plot elements. Theatre scholar Patrice Pavis defines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing, and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts, literature, and the arts in general. Theatre includes performances of plays and musicals. Although it can be defined broadly to include opera and ballet, those art forms are outside the scope of this article."
Thriller;Thrillers are characterized by fast pacing, frequent action, and resourceful heroes who must thwart the plans of more-powerful and better-equipped villains. Literary devices such as suspense, red herrings and cliffhangers are used extensively. Thrillers often overlap with mystery stories, but are distinguished by the structure of their plots. In a thriller, the hero must thwart the plans of an enemy, rather than uncover a crime that has already happened. Thrillers also occur on a much grander scale: the crimes that must be prevented are serial or mass murder, terrorism, assassination, or the overthrow of governments. Jeopardy and violent confrontations are standard plot elements. While a mystery climaxes when the mystery is solved, a thriller climaxes when the hero finally defeats the villain, saving his own life and often the lives of others.
Time Travel;Time travel is the concept of moving between different points in time in a manner analogous to moving between different points in space. Time travel could hypothetically involve moving backward in time to a moment earlier than the starting point, or forward to the future of that point without the need for the traveler to experience the intervening period (at least not at the normal rate). Time travel can form the central theme of a book or it can simply be a plot device to drive a story. Time travel in fiction can ignore the possible effects of the time traveler's actions or it can explote its repercussions (ie: paradoxes).
Translation;The process of converting text from one language to another. Translation of literary works can be highly challenging and is considered a literary pursuit in its own right.
Travel;"Travel is the movement of people or objects (such as airplanes, boats, trains and other conveyances) between relatively distant geographical locations. The term ""travel"" originates from the Old French word travail. Travel writing is a genre that has, as its focus, accounts of real or imaginary places. The genre encompasses a number of styles that may range from the documentary to the evocative, from literary to journalistic, and from the humorous to the serious. Travel writing is often associated with tourism, and includes works of an ephemeral nature such as guide books and reviews, with the intent being to educate the reader about the destination, provide helpful advice for those visiting the destination, and inspire readers to travel to the destination. Travel writing has also been produced by other types of travelers, such as military officers, missionaries, explorers, scientists, pilgrims, and migrants."
Unfinished;"Unfinished works Works that are being not being read right now but will be finished. For ""Started reading, but did not finish reading."" see Did Not Finish ."
Unicorns;The unicorn is a legendary animal from European folklore that resembles a white horse with a large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead, and sometimes a goat's beard and cloven hooves. It was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could only be captured by a virgin. In the encyclopedias its horn was said to have the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness.
Urban Fantasy;Urban fantasy is a subset of contemporary fantasy, consisting of novels and stories with supernatural and/or magical elements set in contemporary, real-world, urban settings--as opposed to 'traditional' fantasy set in imaginary locations. Many urban fantasy novels are told via a first-person narrative, and feature supernatural beings such as vampires, shapeshifters, fairies, witches, sorcerers, and demons. Urban fantasy stories tend to have a high amount of suspense and action, and sometimes include mystery, romance, humor and/or horror in the plotline.
Vampires;Vampires are mythological or folkloric beings who subsist by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of living creatures, regardless of whether they are undead or a living person. They are characterized by fangs, usually retractable, used to suck blood. Vampires are usually killed by a stake to the heart and direct exposure to sunlight. They are often warded off by crosses and the smell of garlic. Since they are undead, they are generally immortal unless killed by one of the aforementioned methods. Often, many are blessed with unnatural and inhuman strength and senses.
War;A war novel is a novel in which the primary action takes place in a field of armed combat, or in a domestic setting (or home front) where the characters are preoccupied with the preparations for, or recovery from, war. See history for specific wars.
Werewolves;See also wolves and Shapeshifters. Shapeshifters focused on the transformation of a human being into a wolf, whether physically or mentally.
Westerns;Westerns are devoted to telling stories set primarily in the latter half of the 19th century in the American Old West, but there are also a number of works about Western-type characters in contemporary settings. Westerns often stress the harshness of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape.
Witches;Witches are humans who participate in magic rituals and who have an unusual affinity to create magic. Depending on the origin of the story/fiction, witches are both male and female. See Paranormal and Wizards
Wizards;"Wizards can refer to male ""witches"" or another form of magic user."
Wolves;Wolves are wild carnivorous animals, part of the Canidae family and related to domestic dogs. Wolves appear in Eurasian and North American folklore as well as in modern fiction. See also werewolves .
~~~~~~~Women Gender Studies;
Womens Fiction;"Women's fiction is an umbrella term for books that are marketed to female readers, and includes many mainstream novels, romantic fiction, ""chick lit,"" and other sub genres. It is distinct from Women's writing, which refers to literature written by (rather than promoted to) women. There exists no comparable label in English for works of fiction that are marketed to males. The Romance Writers of America organization defines women's fiction as, ""a commercial novel about a woman on the brink of life change and personal growth. Her journey details emotional reflection and action that transforms her and her relationships with others, and includes a hopeful/upbeat ending with regard to her romantic relationship."""

Young Adult;Young-adult fiction (often abbreviated as YA) is fiction written for, published for, or marketed to adolescents and young adults, roughly ages 13 to 18. Young-adult fiction, whether in the form of novels or short stories, has distinct attributes that distinguish it from the other age categories of fiction. The vast majority of YA stories portray an adolescent as the protagonist, rather than an adult or a child. The subject matter and story lines are typically consistent with the age and experience of the main character, but beyond that YA stories span the entire spectrum of fiction genres. The settings of YA stories are limited only by the imagination and skill of the author. Themes in YA stories often focus on the challenges of youth, so much so that the entire age category is sometimes referred to as problem novels or coming of age novel. Writing styles of YA stories range widely, from the richness of literary style to the clarity and speed of the unobtrusive. Despite its unique characteristics, YA shares the fundamental elements of fiction with other stories: character, plot, setting, theme, and style.
Zombies;Zombies are living-dead creatures often referred to as flesh eating or brain eating creatures spread by an infection such as a virus or by a bite. They're usually seen in the Horror genre, but can also be seen in other forms of speculative fiction.
