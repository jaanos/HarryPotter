19th Century;Novels or collections of stories set during the 19th century. The 19th century (January 1, 1801 – December 31, 1900) was the century marked by the collapse of the Spanish, First and Second French, Chinese, Holy Roman and Mughal empires. This paved the way for the growing influence of the British Empire, the Russian Empire, the United States, the German Empire, the Second French Colonial Empire and the Empire of Japan, with the British boasting unchallenged dominance after 1815.

Adventure;Adventure fiction is a genre of fiction in which an adventure, an exciting undertaking involving risk and physical danger, forms the main storyline. Adventure novels and short stories were popular subjects for American pulp magazines, which dominated American popular fiction between the Progressive Era and the 1950s. Adventure fiction often overlaps with other genres, notably war novels, crime novels, sea stories, Robinsonades, spy stories (as in the works of John Buchan, Eric Ambler and Ian Fleming), science fiction, fantasy, (Robert E. Howard and J.R.R. Tolkien both combined the secondary world story with the adventure novel)[6] and Westerns. Not all books within these genres are adventures. Adventure fiction takes the setting and premise of these other genres, but the fast-paced plot of an adventure focuses on the actions of the hero within the setting. See also pulp adventure .
Aliens;Aliens are extraterrestrial life that does not originate from Earth. The sentient beings can range from simple bacteria-life organisms to complex species and individuals. Aliens are used in a variety of genres, most notably Science-Fiction .
Alternate History;"Alternate history is a subgenre of speculative fiction (or science fiction) and historical fiction that is set in a world in which history has diverged from the actual history of the world. Alternate history literature asks the question, ""What if history had developed differently?"" Most works in this genre are based on real historical events, yet feature social, geopolitical, or industrial circumstances that developed differently than our own."
Angels;"Angels are messengers of God in the Hebrew and Christian Bibles. The term ""angel"" has also been expanded to various notions of spiritual beings found in many other religious traditions. Other roles of angels include protecting and guiding human beings, and carrying out God's tasks. Angels are often depicted with wings and halos. They are kind and loving beings who often comfort and heal human beings."
Animals;Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). All animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently, at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.
Art;Books that showcase particular types of art.
Arthurian;Arthurian subgenre tales are set in the world of King Arthur's legendary Camelot. Merlin, Lancelot, Ygraine and friends are involved in fresh adventures. These novels have been popular for centuries, and one famous modern example is Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow.

Autobiography;"An autobiography (from the Greek, αὐτός-autos self + βίος-bios life + γράφειν-graphein to write) is a book about the life of a person, written by that person. Closely associated with autobiography (and sometimes difficult to precisely distinguish from it) is the form of memoir. However, an autobiography typically focuses on the ""life and times"" of the writer, while a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Also see Biography Memoir and Memoir ."
Biography;"A biography (from the Greek words bios meaning ""life"", and graphos meaning ""write"") is an account of a person's life, usually published in the form of a book or essay, or in some other form, such as a film."

Boarding School;This genre is for books that take place in boarding schools.
Chick Lit;Chick lit is genre fiction which addresses issues of modern womanhood, often humorously and lightheartedly. Although it sometimes includes romantic elements, chick lit is generally not considered a direct subcategory of the romance novel genre, because the heroine's relationship with her family or friends is often just as important as her romantic relationships.
Childrens;Children's literature is for readers and listeners up to about age 12. It is often illustrated. The term is used in senses that sometimes exclude young-adult fiction, comic books, or other genres. Books specifically for children existed at least several hundred years ago.

Christian;"The term ""Christian"" is used adjectivally to describe anything associated with Christianity, or in a proverbial sense ""all that is noble, and good, and Christ-like"". It can also refer to content produced by a christian without the content being explicitly Christian."
Classics;"A classic stands the test of time. The work is usually considered to be a representation of the period in which it was written; and the work merits lasting recognition. In other words, if the book was published in the recent past, the work is not a classic. A classic has a certain universal appeal. Great works of literature touch us to our very core beings--partly because they integrate themes that are understood by readers from a wide range of backgrounds and levels of experience. Themes of love, hate, death, life, and faith touch upon some of our most basic emotional responses. Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature from all traditions, such as the Chinese classics or the Indian Vedas. Disambiguation: The study of ancient (""classical"") civilisations and languages, see Classical studies ."

Crime;"The crime genre includes the broad selection of books on criminals and the court system, but the most common focus is investigations and sleuthing. Mystery novels are usually placed into this category, although there is a separate division for ""crime"". Hard Case Crime is one example."
Dragons;Dragons are legendary creatures, typically with serpentine or otherwise reptilian traits, that feature in the myths of many cultures. There are two distinct cultural traditions of dragons: the European dragon, derived from European folk traditions and ultimately related to Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies, and the Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan, Korea and other Asian countries. The traditional European dragon is a large reptilian creature with wings who lives in underground caves filled with treasure. They can breathe fire. Chinese dragons are more serpentine in shape who possess four legs and no wings. They are often considered signs of good luck, power and strength. Dragons vary drastically according to different stories and mythology. Some can talk and perform magic. Some can assume human form. Some are affiliated with non-fire elements and can breathe ice, lightning and other elements.
Dystopia;Dystopia is a form of literature that explores social and political structures. It is a creation of a nightmare world - unlike its opposite, Utopia, which is an ideal world. Dystopia is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. It often features different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions, and a state of constant warfare or violence. Many novels combine both Dystopia and Utopia, often as a metaphor for the different directions humanity can take in its choices, ending up with one of the two possible futures.
Ebooks;An electronic book (eBook) is a digital form of a book that consists of text and sometimes images, or both. Common formats of ebooks include: .iba(Apple iBooks), .azw(Amazon Kindle), EPUB and PDF files.

Epic Fantasy;"Epic Fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy that is set in invented or parallel world. It is most commonly cosidered to be the same genre as High Fantasy, since they share many of the same elements, but Epic Fantasy takes the story even farther, in a bigger and more epic way (e.g. the stakes are greater; the land/world is in peril; a great evil threatens the world; the conflict shakes all who dwell in the world of the story). Epic Fantasy became more famous through the works of such as: Terry Brooks, Raymond E. Feist, Tad Williams, Robert Jordan, George R.R. Martin and Steven Erikson; though it's origins come long before, from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings ."
Epic;The story is centered on heroic characters, and the action takes place on a grand scale. See also epic poetry and epic fantasy .
Fairies;A fairy (also faery, faerie, fay, fae) is a type of mythical being or legendary creature, a form of spirit, often described as metaphysical, supernatural or preternatural.
Fairy Tale Retellings;Retellings of fairytales.
Fairy Tales;"Fairy tale is a type of short narrative that typically features such folkloric characters, such as fairies, goblins, elves, trolls, dwarves, giants or gnomes, and usually magic or enchantments. However, only a small number of the stories thus designated explicitly refer to fairies. Fairy tales are high fantasy based on stories that are not only not true, but that couldn't possibly be true, while Legends are sometimes perceived as real or plausible. Fairy tales may merge into legends, where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth. However, unlike legends and epics, they usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and actual places, people, and events; they take place once upon a time rather than in actual times. See also fairies ."
Fantasy Romance;"Romantic fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy fiction, describing a fantasy story using many of the elements and conventions of the romance genre. One of the key features of romantic fantasy involves the focus on relationships, social, political, and romantic. Romantic fantasy has been published by both fantasy lines and romance lines. Some publishers distinguish between ""romantic fantasy"" where the romance is most important and ""fantasy romance"" where the fantasy elements are most important. Others say that ""the borderline between fantasy romance and romantic fantasy has essentially ceased to exist, or if it's still there, it's moving back and forth constantly""."
Fantasy;Fantasy is a genre that uses magic and other supernatural forms as a primary element of plot, theme, and/or setting. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of technological and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (collectively known as speculative fiction or science fiction/fantasy ) In its broadest sense, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today, including young adults, most of whom are represented by the works below.
Favorites;A subjective genre for books people consider to be their favorites.
Fiction;"Fiction is the telling of stories which are not real. More specifically, fiction is an imaginative form of narrative, one of the four basic rhetorical modes. Although the word fiction is derived from the Latin fingo, fingere, finxi, fictum, ""to form, create"", works of fiction need not be entirely imaginary and may include real people, places, and events. Fiction may be either written or oral. Although not all fiction is necessarily artistic, fiction is largely perceived as a form of art or entertainment. The ability to create fiction and other artistic works is considered to be a fundamental aspect of human culture, one of the defining characteristics of humanity."
Lgbt;"LGBT is an initialism that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism LGB, which was used to replace the term gay in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s. The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures. It may be used to refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996. Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI. Some people combine the two acronyms and use the term LGBTIQ. Others use LGBT+ to encompass a spectrum of gender and sexuality. There is also a rise in the use of the acronym QUILTBAG to encompass either ""Asexual"" or ""Ally"" as the A, and the G to cover both the more usual ""Gay"" as well as ""Gender-Questioning""/""Gender-Queer""."
Gothic;Gothic fiction is a genre of literature that combines elements of both the uncanny and romance. As a genre, it is generally believed to have been invented by the English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto. Gothic fiction is considered to be the parent genre for both Horror and Mystery , among other genres. The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. Melodrama and parody (including self-parody) were other long-standing features of the Gothic initiated by Walpole. Gothic literature is intimately associated with the Gothic Revival architecture of the same era. In a way similar to the gothic revivalists' rejection of the clarity and rationalism of the neoclassical style of the Enlightened Establishment, the literary Gothic embodies an appreciation of the joys of extreme emotion, the thrills of fearfulness and awe inherent in the sublime, and a quest for atmosphere. The ruins of gothic buildings gave rise to multiple linked emotions by representing the inevitable decay and collapse of human creations — thus the urge to add fake ruins as eye catchers in English landscape parks. English Gothic writers often associated medieval buildings with what they saw as a dark and terrifying period, characterized by harsh laws enforced by torture, and with mysterious, fantastic, and superstitious rituals. In literature such anti-Catholicism had a European dimension featuring Roman Catholic excesses such as the Inquisition (in southern European countries such as Italy and Spain). Prominent features of Gothic fiction include terror (both psychological and physical), mystery, the supernatural, ghosts, haunted houses and Gothic architecture, castles, darkness, death, decay, doubles, madness, secrets, and hereditary curses. The stock characters of Gothic fiction include tyrants, villains, bandits, maniacs, Byronic heroes, persecuted maidens, femmes fatales, monks, nuns, madwomen, magicians, vampires, werewolves, monsters, demons, angels, fallen angels, revenants, ghosts, perambulating skeletons, the Wandering Jew and the Devil himself.
Graphic Novels;A graphic novel is a narrative work in which the story is conveyed to the reader using sequential art in either an experimental design or in a traditional comics format. The term is employed in a broad manner, encompassing non-fiction works and thematically linked short stories as well as fictional stories across a number of genres. -- from Wikipedia

High Fantasy;"High fantasy is defined as fantasy fiction set in an alternative, entirely fictional (""secondary"") world, rather than the real, or ""primary"" world. The secondary world is usually internally consistent but its rules differ in some way(s) from those of the primary world. By contrast, low fantasy is characterized by being set in the primary, or ""real"" world, or a rational and familiar fictional world, with the inclusion of magical elements."
Historical Fiction;Historical fiction presents a story set in the past, often during a significant time period. In historical fiction, the time period is an important part of the setting and often of the story itself. Historical fiction may include fictional characters, well-known historical figures or a mixture of the two. Authors of historical fiction usually pay close attention to the details of their stories (settings, clothing, dialogue, etc.) to ensure that they fit the time periods in which the narratives take place. In some historical fiction, famous events appear from points of view not recorded in history, showing historical figures dealing with actual events while depicting them in a way that is not recorded in history. Other times, the historical event or time period complements a story's narrative, forming a framework and background for the characters' lives. Sometimes, historical fiction can be for the most part true, but the names of people and places have been in some way altered. As this is fiction, artistic license is permitted in regard to presentation and subject matter, so long as it does not deviate in significant ways from established history. If events should deviate significantly, the story may then fall into the genre of alternate history , which is known for speculating on what could have happened if a significant historical event had gone differently. On a similar note, events occurring in historical fiction must adhere to the laws of physics. Stories that extend into the magical or fantastic are often considered historical fantasy. See also historical romance .

History;"History (from Greek ἱστορία - historia, meaning ""inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation"") is the discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented. Scholars who write about history are called historians. It is a field of research which uses a narrative to examine and analyse the sequence of events, and it sometimes attempts to investigate objectively the patterns of cause and effect that determine events. Historians debate the nature of history and its usefulness. This includes discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing ""perspective"" on the problems of the present. The stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the legends surrounding King Arthur) are usually classified as cultural heritage rather than the ""disinterested investigation"" needed by the discipline of history. Events of the past prior to written record are considered prehistory. Amongst scholars, the fifth century BC Greek historian Herodotus is considered to be the ""father of history"", and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, forms the foundations for the modern study of history. Their influence, along with other historical traditions in other parts of their world, have spawned many different interpretations of the nature of history which has evolved over the centuries and are continuing to change. The modern study of history has many different fields including those that focus on certain regions and those which focus on certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in University studies."
Horror;"Horror fiction is fiction in any medium intended to scare, unsettle, or horrify the audience. Historically, the cause of the ""horror"" experience has often been the intrusion of a supernatural element into everyday human experience. Since the 1960s, any work of fiction with a morbid, gruesome, surreal, or exceptionally suspenseful or frightening theme has come to be called ""horror"". Horror fiction often overlaps science fiction or fantasy, all three of which categories are sometimes placed under the umbrella classification speculative fiction."
Horses;Horses have been domesticated by humans for thousands of years. Once used for transportation, hauling, and war, they are now kept mostly for sports, recreation, and companionship. See also horse racing .
Humor;A comic novel is usually a work of fiction in which the writer seeks to amuse the reader, sometimes with subtlety and as part of a carefully woven narrative, sometimes above all other considerations. It could indeed be said that comedy fiction is literary work that aims primarily to provoke laughter, but this isn't always as obvious as it first may seem.

Japanese Literature;Early works of Japanese literature were heavily influenced by cultural contact with China and Chinese literature, often written in Classical Chinese. Indian literature also had an influence through the diffusion of Buddhism in Japan. Eventually, Japanese literature developed into a separate style in its own right as Japanese writers began writing their own works about Japan, although the influence of Chinese literature and Classical Chinese remained until the end of the Edo period. Since Japan reopened its ports to Western trading and diplomacy in the 19th century, Western and Eastern literature have strongly affected each other and continue to do so.

Literary Fiction;"Literary fiction is a term that has come into common usage in the early 1960s. The term is principally used to distinguish ""serious fiction"" which is a work that claims to hold literary merit, in comparison from genre fiction and popular fiction. The name literature is sometimes used for this genre, although it can also refer to a broader category of writing."
Literature;"Literature is the art of written works. The two most basic written literary categories include fiction and non-fiction , although ""literature"" in popular use can also mean a sub-genre of fiction called literary fiction ."
Magic;These are all books that deal with magic: wands, spells, curses, potions, hexes, thoughts (mind-magic), art, symbols, rituals, magical languages, witchcraft, etc. See also magick for non-fiction.
Magical Realism;"Magical realism is a fiction genre in which magical elements blend to create a realistic atmosphere that accesses a deeper understanding of reality. The story explains these magical elements as normal occurrences, presented in a straightforward manner that places the ""real"" and the ""fantastic"" in the same stream of thought."
Manga;Japanese or Japanese-influenced comics and graphic novels. Usually printed in black-and-white. There are many genres inside manga, the most distinct being shojo (for girls) and shonen (for boys).

Memoir;"As a literary genre, a memoir (from the French: mémoire from the Latin memoria, meaning ""memory"", or a reminiscence), forms a subclass of autobiography – although the terms 'memoir' and 'autobiography' are almost interchangeable in modern parlance. Memoir is autobiographical writing, but not all autobiographical writing follows the criteria for memoir. Memoirs are structured differently from formal autobiographies which tend to encompass the writer's entire life span, focusing on the development of his/her personality. The chronological scope of memoir is determined by the work's context and is therefore more focused and flexible than the traditional arc of birth to childhood to old age as found in an autobiography. Memoirs tended to be written by politicians or people in court society, later joined by military leaders and businessmen, and often dealt exclusively with the writer's careers rather than their private life. Historically, memoirs have dealt with public matters, rather than personal. Many older memoirs contain little or no information about the writer, and are almost entirely concerned with other people. Modern expectations have changed this, even for heads of government. Like most autobiographies, memoirs are generally written from the first person point of view. Gore Vidal, in his own memoir Palimpsest, gave a personal definition: ""a memoir is how one remembers one's own life, while an autobiography is history, requiring research, dates, facts double-checked."" It is more about what can be gleaned from a section of one's life than about the outcome of the life as a whole. Humorist Will Rogers put it a little more pithily: ""Memoirs means when you put down the good things you ought to have done and leave out the bad ones you did do."""

Mystery Thriller;Mystery-thrillers are stories with twists and turns that keep you on your toes guessing about the truth, the POV's truth, and about what will happen next. They can be written from a hero's POV or from a sinister character's POV. Some are scary and make your heart beat faster, making it hard to put down.

Mystery;"Mystery fiction is a loosely-defined term that is often used as a synonym of detective fiction — in other words a novel or short story in which a detective (either professional or amateur) solves a crime. The term ""mystery fiction"" may sometimes be limited to the subset of detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle element and its logical solution (cf. whodunit), as a contrast to hardboiled detective stories which focus on action and gritty realism. However, in more general usage ""mystery"" may be used to describe any form of crime fiction, even if there is no mystery to be solved. For example, the Mystery Writers of America describes itself as ""the premier organization for mystery writers, professionals allied to the crime writing field, aspiring crime writers, and those who are devoted to the genre"". Although normally associated with the crime genre, the term ""mystery fiction"" may in certain situations refer to a completely different genre, where the focus is on supernatural mystery (even if no crime is involved). This usage was common in the pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s, where titles such as Dime Mystery, Thrilling Mystery and Spicy Mystery offered what at the time were described as ""weird menace"" stories – supernatural horror in the vein of Grand Guignol. This contrasted with parallel titles such as Dime Detective, Thrilling Detective and Spicy Detective, which contained conventional hardboiled crime fiction. The first use of ""mystery"" in this sense was by Dime Mystery, which started out as an ordinary crime fiction magazine but switched to ""weird menace"" during the latter part of 1933."
Mythology;"The term mythology can refer to a body of myths or to any traditional story. A myth is a sacred narrative explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form. The main characters in myths are usually gods or supernatural heroes. The study of myth began in ancient history. Rival classes of the Greek myths by Euhemerus, Plato and Sallustius were developed by the Neoplatonists and later revived by Renaissance mythographers. The nineteenth-century comparative mythology reinterpreted myth as a primitive and failed counterpart of science (Tylor), a ""disease of language"" (Müller), or a misinterpretation of magical ritual (Frazer)."
New Adult;New Adult fiction bridges the gap between Young Adult and Adult genres. It typically features protagonists between the ages of 18 and 25 with the cap at 30ish. The genre tends to focus on issues prevalent in the young adult genre as well as focusing on issues experienced by individuals between the area of childhood and adulthood, such as leaving home for university and getting a job. New adult is typically considered a subcategory of adult literature rather than young adult literature. Some popular new adult titles include The Magicians by Lev Grossman, A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas, Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire and Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell.
Nonfiction;"Non-fiction is an account or representation of a subject which is presented as fact. This presentation may be accurate or not; that is, it can give either a true or a false account of the subject in question. However, it is generally assumed that the authors of such accounts believe them to be truthful at the time of their composition. Note that reporting the beliefs of others in a nonfiction format is not necessarily an endorsement of the ultimate veracity of those beliefs, it is simply saying that it is true that people believe that (for such topics as mythology, religion). Non-fiction can also be written about fiction, giving information about these other works. Non-fiction is one of the two main divisions in writing, particularly used in libraries, the other being fiction. However, non-fiction need not be written text necessarily, since pictures and film can also purport to present a factual account of a subject."
Novels;A novel is a long prose narrative that usually describes fictional characters and events in the form of a sequential story. It rests on the consensus that the novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose, followed by the novella, novelette and the short story. However, there is no consensus as to the minimal required lenght. In part because of this wide variation, the boundary between a novella and a novel may be arbitrary and difficult to determine. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America specifies a word length of over 40,000 words for a novel, while National Novel Writing Month requires its novels to be at least 50,000 words.
Paranormal Romance;Paranormal romance is a sub-genre of the romance novel related to paranormal fiction . Paranormal romance focuses on romance and includes elements beyond the range of scientific explanation, blending together themes from the genres of urban fantasy, traditional fantasy, science fiction, or horror. Paranormal romance may range from traditional category romances with a paranormal setting to stories where the main emphasis is on a science fiction or fantasy based plot with a romantic subplot included. Paranormal romance stories tend to feature a lot of romance, suspense and action, as well as sometimes include mystery, humor and/or horror in the plotline. Common hallmarks are romantic relationships between humans, vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters, fairies, demons, witches, sorcerers, ghosts, and other entities of a supernatural or otherworldly nature. Beyond the more prevalent themes involving vampires, shapeshifters, or time travel, paranormal romances can also include books featuring characters with psychic abilities, like telekinesis or telepathy. “Paranormal Romance: Romance novels in which the future, a fantasy world, or paranormal happenings are an integral part of the plot.” See also: * erotic paranormal romance * paranormal
Paranormal;Paranormal books involve unusual experiences that lack a scientific explanation. Some popular subjects in paranormal books are supernatural creatures, ESP, clairvoyance, ghosts, UFOs, telepathy, and psychics. A subgenre of paranormal books and of romances is paranormal romance . These books focus mainly on the romantic relationships with a background theme of vampires, shapeshifters, ghosts, time travel, fantastical beings, and psychic abilities.
Philosophy;"Philosophy is the study of general problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, truth, beauty, justice, validity, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these questions (such as mysticism or mythology) by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument. The word philosophy is of Ancient Greek origin: φιλοσοφία (philosophía), meaning ""love of wisdom."""
Pirates;"Fiction or non-fiction books involving pirates. Those who engage in acts of robbery or criminal violence at sea are called pirates. Piracy has existed from ancient times to the modern day, but much literature focuses on the ""Golden Age of Piracy"" from about the 1650s to the 1730s."
Poetry;Poetry is a form of literary art in which language is used for its aesthetic and evocative qualities in addition to, or in lieu of, its apparent meaning. Poetry may be written independently, as discrete poems, or may occur in conjunction with other arts, as in poetic drama, hymns or lyrics. Poetry, and discussions of it, have a long history. Early attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy.[1] Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition and rhyme, and emphasised the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from prose.[2] From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more loosely defined as a fundamental creative act using language.[3] Poetry often uses particular forms and conventions to expand the literal meaning of the words, or to evoke emotional or sensual responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. Poetry's use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor and simile create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm. Some forms of poetry are specific to particular cultures and genres, responding to the characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. While readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as being written in rhyming lines and regular meter, there are traditions, such as those of Du Fu and Beowulf, that use other approaches to achieve rhythm and euphony. In today's globalized world, poets often borrow styles, techniques and forms from diverse cultures and languages.
Politics;"Politics (from Greek πολιτικός, ""of, for, or relating to citizens""), is a process by which groups of people make collective decisions. The term is generally applied to the art or science of running governmental or state affairs. It also refers to behavior within civil governments. However, politics can be observed in other group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. It consists of ""social relations involving authority or power"" and refers to the regulation of public affairs within a political unit, and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply policy."
Realistic Fiction;Realistic Fiction seems like real life, with characters dealing with real life problems. The plot often takes place in the present time. The situations are true or could be, but the main characters are fictional.
Spirituality;Spirituality may refer to almost any kind of meaningful activity, personal growth, or blissful experience. Traditionally, spirituality refers to a process of re-formation of the personality but there is no precise definition of spirituality.
Religion;Religion is a cultural system that establishes symbols that relate humanity to spirituality and moral values. Many religions have narratives, symbols, traditions and sacred histories that are intended to give meaning to life or to explain the origin of life or the universe. They tend to derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle from their ideas about the cosmos and human nature.
Retellings;A new version of an older story. Sometimes, a fairy tale or myth may be reimagined with a modernized setting or retold from a minor character's perspective.
Romance;"According to the Romance Writers of America, ""Two basic elements comprise every romance novel: a central love story and an emotionally-satisfying and optimistic ending."" Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Other definitions of a romance novel may be broader, including other plots and endings or more than two people, or narrower, restricting the types of romances or conflicts."
School Stories;Books set at school, typically centering on pre-adolescent and adolescent school life. School stories are frequently set in boarding schools, often single-sex, and focus largely on friendship and loyalty between pupils. See also academic .

Science Fiction;"Science fiction (abbreviated SF or sci-fi with varying punctuation and capitalization) is a broad genre of fiction that often involves speculations based on current or future science or technology. Science fiction is found in books, art, television, films, games, theatre, and other media. In organizational or marketing contexts, science fiction can be synonymous with the broader definition of speculative fiction , encompassing creative works incorporating imaginative elements not found in contemporary reality; this includes fantasy , horror and related genres. Although the two genres are often conflated as science fiction/fantasy , science fiction differs from fantasy in that, within the context of the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated laws of nature (though some elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation). Exploring the consequences of such differences is the traditional purpose of science fiction, making it a ""literature of ideas"". Science fantasy is largely based on writing entertainingly and rationally about alternate possibilities in settings that are contrary to known reality."

Sequential Art;Sequential art refers to the art form of using a train of images deployed in sequence to tell a story or convey information. The best-known examples of sequential art are comics , graphic novels , and manga .

Shonen;The term shōnen, shonen, or shounen manga (少年漫画) refers to manga marketed to a teen male audience.
Short Stories;"A short story is a short work of prose fiction. It may be in any genre of fiction, and the exact definition of ""short"" will often depend on the genre. Short stories are often collected together with other short stories, poetry, art, and/or essays in order to form a larger book, although it is becoming more common for short stories to be released as stand-alone ebooks."
Space Opera;Space opera is a subgenre of speculative fiction or science fiction that emphasizes romantic, often melodramatic adventure, set mainly or entirely in space, generally involving conflict between opponents possessing powerful (and sometimes quite fanciful) technologies and abilities. Perhaps the most significant trait of space opera is that settings, characters, battles, powers, and themes tend to be very large-scale. Also see Planetary Romance ,which has similarities.
Space;"""Space"" may refer to stories (usually science fiction ) which are set in outer space or it may refer to non-fiction about outer space (especially sciences such as astronomy )."
Spirituality;Spirituality may refer to almost any kind of meaningful activity, personal growth, or blissful experience. Traditionally, spirituality refers to a process of re-formation of the personality but there is no precise definition of spirituality.
Steampunk;"Steampunk is a subgenre of speculative fiction, usually set in an anachronistic Victorian or quasi-Victorian alternate history setting. It could be described by the slogan ""What the past would look like if the future had happened sooner."" It includes fiction with science fiction, fantasy or horror themes. It is a subgenre of fantasy and speculative fiction that came into prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s. The term denotes works set in an era or world where STEAM POWER is still widely used—usually the 19th century, and often set in Victorian era England—but with prominent elements of either science fiction or fantasy, such as fictional technological inventions like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, or real technological developments like the computer occurring at an earlier date. Dieselpunk takes over where Steampunk leaves off. These are stories that take over as we usher in the machine-heavy eras of WWI and WWII. The use of diesel-powered machines plays heavily. In this (like its steam counterpart), the focus is on the technology."
Supernatural;"The supernatural genre is fiction about witches, vampires, ghosts, werewolves, shape shifters, demons, angels, or anything else in the paranormal or otherworldly realm. A sub-category is ""supernatural-romance"" in which the plot revolves around the main female character and the romance storyline. Also see Paranormal ."
Surrealism;"Surrealist works feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur; however, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact."
Suspense;"Suspense is a feeling of uncertainty and anxiety about the outcome of certain actions, most often referring to an audience's perceptions in a dramatic work. Suspense is not exclusive to fiction, though. Suspense may operate in any situation where there is a lead up to a big event or dramatic moment, with tension being a primary emotion felt as part of the situation. In the kind of suspense described by film director Alfred Hitchcock, an audience experiences suspense when they expect something bad to happen and have (or believe they have) a superior perspective on events in the drama's hierarchy of knowledge, yet they are powerless to intervene to prevent it from happening. In broader definitions of suspense, this emotion arises when someone is aware of his lack of knowledge about the development of a meaningful event; thus, suspense is a combination of anticipation and uncertainty dealing with the obscurity of the future. In terms of narrative expectations, it may be contrasted with mystery or curiosity and surprise."
Teen;Books for teenagers.
Thriller;Thrillers are characterized by fast pacing, frequent action, and resourceful heroes who must thwart the plans of more-powerful and better-equipped villains. Literary devices such as suspense, red herrings and cliffhangers are used extensively. Thrillers often overlap with mystery stories, but are distinguished by the structure of their plots. In a thriller, the hero must thwart the plans of an enemy, rather than uncover a crime that has already happened. Thrillers also occur on a much grander scale: the crimes that must be prevented are serial or mass murder, terrorism, assassination, or the overthrow of governments. Jeopardy and violent confrontations are standard plot elements. While a mystery climaxes when the mystery is solved, a thriller climaxes when the hero finally defeats the villain, saving his own life and often the lives of others.
Translation;The process of converting text from one language to another. Translation of literary works can be highly challenging and is considered a literary pursuit in its own right.

Urban Fantasy;Urban fantasy is a subset of contemporary fantasy, consisting of novels and stories with supernatural and/or magical elements set in contemporary, real-world, urban settings--as opposed to 'traditional' fantasy set in imaginary locations. Many urban fantasy novels are told via a first-person narrative, and feature supernatural beings such as vampires, shapeshifters, fairies, witches, sorcerers, and demons. Urban fantasy stories tend to have a high amount of suspense and action, and sometimes include mystery, romance, humor and/or horror in the plotline.
Vampires;Vampires are mythological or folkloric beings who subsist by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of living creatures, regardless of whether they are undead or a living person. They are characterized by fangs, usually retractable, used to suck blood. Vampires are usually killed by a stake to the heart and direct exposure to sunlight. They are often warded off by crosses and the smell of garlic. Since they are undead, they are generally immortal unless killed by one of the aforementioned methods. Often, many are blessed with unnatural and inhuman strength and senses.
War;A war novel is a novel in which the primary action takes place in a field of armed combat, or in a domestic setting (or home front) where the characters are preoccupied with the preparations for, or recovery from, war. See history for specific wars.
Womens Fiction;"Women's fiction is an umbrella term for books that are marketed to female readers, and includes many mainstream novels, romantic fiction, ""chick lit,"" and other sub genres. It is distinct from Women's writing, which refers to literature written by (rather than promoted to) women. There exists no comparable label in English for works of fiction that are marketed to males. The Romance Writers of America organization defines women's fiction as, ""a commercial novel about a woman on the brink of life change and personal growth. Her journey details emotional reflection and action that transforms her and her relationships with others, and includes a hopeful/upbeat ending with regard to her romantic relationship."""
Young Adult Fantasy;Fantasy books in which the protagonist is under the age of 18. For readers between the ages of 12 and 17.
Young Adult Contemporary;Modern fiction geared towards teens roughly 13 to 18 years old. Main characters are usually teenagers or younger adults. Young Adult Contemporary is often realistic, but can overlap with fantasy or magic realism.
Young Adult Fantasy;Fantasy books in which the protagonist is under the age of 18. For readers between the ages of 12 and 17.
Young Adult;Young-adult fiction (often abbreviated as YA) is fiction written for, published for, or marketed to adolescents and young adults, roughly ages 13 to 18. Young-adult fiction, whether in the form of novels or short stories, has distinct attributes that distinguish it from the other age categories of fiction. The vast majority of YA stories portray an adolescent as the protagonist, rather than an adult or a child. The subject matter and story lines are typically consistent with the age and experience of the main character, but beyond that YA stories span the entire spectrum of fiction genres. The settings of YA stories are limited only by the imagination and skill of the author. Themes in YA stories often focus on the challenges of youth, so much so that the entire age category is sometimes referred to as problem novels or coming of age novel. Writing styles of YA stories range widely, from the richness of literary style to the clarity and speed of the unobtrusive. Despite its unique characteristics, YA shares the fundamental elements of fiction with other stories: character, plot, setting, theme, and style.
